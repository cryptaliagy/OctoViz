# OctoViz

A tool to visualize PR lifetime data from Github!

Before using, ensure you have a github OAuth token to use.

You can set the URL (for Enterprise environments) and the token at runtime with flags or through the GITHUB_API_TOKEN and GITHUB_URL environment variables

To install, simply use `pip install .`. For usage, check `python octoviz.py -h` for more information. A virtual environment is strongly encouraged
